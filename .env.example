# Knowledge Service — Example Client Configuration
# ==================================================
# Copy this to .env for local tool usage.
# The .env file is gitignored — do not commit it.
#
# This configures the CLIENT-SIDE tools (health checks, integration
# tests). The SERVER-SIDE config (vLLM endpoints, SeekDB, chunker URL)
# lives in the knowledge-service stack's secrets.env, injected at deploy time.

# Knowledge Service endpoint (deployed on Docker host)
# Replace PORT with the external port mapped to container port 8000
KNOWLEDGE_SERVICE_URL=http://your-docker-host:PORT
